  - "Ylva, what\u2019s next for our expedition? "
  - "Hmm. There is a greater disturbance I\u2019ve noticed near the edges of the dungeon
    walls in the second level. It\u2019s probably worth investigating given that the
    monsters seem to be more aggressive the closer we get to that area."
  - It might be the appearance of something powerful, but then again it could be some
    adventurer frightening all of them.
  - 'Speaking of adventurers Ylva, are there any adventurers that we have to be aware
    of? '
  - "You mean if there\u2019s any adventurers that might attack us?"
  - There may be a few rag tag groups on the first level that attack returning ships
    for any artifact and gold they find.
  - "My impression is though, that there aren\u2019t many groups crazy enough to venture
    beyond the first level, given how cold and harsh it is down here. "
  - "That\u2019s good to hear."
  - Then, do you know how many adventurers there are on the second level then?
  - "I\u2019ve seen a few groups, although each layer of the labyrinth grows in size
    as you venture deeper, so you\u2019re more unlikely to come across adventurer
    groups. "
  - "we might come across Sal the anchor though. I crossed paths with him a while
    ago in the hideout. He\u2019s proven to have been down to the fifth layer as well. "
  - Another fifth layer adventurer is here with us on the second level right now??
  - Apparently there are some that have ventured beyond the fifth level and living
    in the outside world. Ever heard of Jazz or Magni and Ahalfar?
  - "Magni the Thunderstorm? Yes, I have. He\u2019s known for exploring the entire
    labyrinth right? But he went missing ever since he last returned. His partner
    Ahalfar was equally as legendary, but it\u2019s said that he died in the labyrinth
    when adventuring with Magni."
  - 'Jazz the Moon Sovereign made it to the sixth level, but stopped adventuring after
    contracting an unknown illness. '
  - "The \u201CMoon Sovereign\u201D?  "
  - "Yes. \u201CComet Reign\u201D - an artifact that could summon small bolts of light,
    which made the entire room sparkle with dazzling lights. "
  - Her co-adventurers said they never missed what it was like outside, as she brought
    the night sky with her.
  - 'Wow.. '
  - "I wonder what I have to do to be awarded a title by the guild. I want to be known
    as something like \u201CGeordi the Strong\u201D or \u201CGeordi the Wise\u201D.
    Something that my little sister can be proud of. "
  - 'Ylva forces herself not to smile too much. '
  - "There\u2019s two things actually. Although the requirements are rather vague. "
  - You'll first need to accomplish an impressive feat. Usually this means either
    defeating monsters or finding new labyrinth areas.
  - "But if it\u2019s something new and not easily accomplished, then it most likely
    fits the criteria."
  - 'The other is to own a legendary class artifact. To the guild, titles are ways
    to raise legends about adventurers accomplishing great tasks, which helps bring
    more adventurers to these water towns around the labyrinth walls. '
  - 'Having an iconic ability or weapon helps people to remember you. '
  - ".. It doesn\u2019t seem like i\u2019m going to be something legendary any time
    soon then. Finding a legendary artifact is one thing.. But doing something spectacular
    like defeating a monster or discovering something amazing.. Who knows if i\u2019ll
    be able to do that in my lifetime."
  - "I felt the same way Geordi. But this labyrinth always gives to those who do really
    want it. As you explore more, I'm sure you\u2019ll find your opportunity."
  - "After all, we never know what\u2019s in here. There are so many things to explore
    and find, I doubt we\u2019ve uncovered even half of it."
  - "...you make a good point, Ylva. It means a lot coming from someone who\u2019s
    accomplished so much. Thank you."
  - "Not at all! I only wish the best for adventurers that were once like me, ambitious
    and brave. And besides, I\u2019m sure your little sister is already proud of her
    brave brother, adventuring into this labyrinth everyday."
