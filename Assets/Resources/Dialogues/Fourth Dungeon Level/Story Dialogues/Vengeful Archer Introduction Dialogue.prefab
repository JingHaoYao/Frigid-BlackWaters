  - 'Hey Usanoo, can you tell us more about this labyrinth, that you call Nif? '
  - "Merrow once told me that in the ancient language, it means the \u201Ccenter\u201D.
    Where the anima streams of the world collide and crash. "
  - "There\u2019s an ancient legend that\u2019s passed down among our young as a
    children\u2019s story. That Nif was raised from the ocean by two great beings. "
  - 'The first of the two raised huge storms and waves with his colossal strength. '
  - 'The second quelled those storms and used her voice to calm the seas. '
  - 'It was said that the actions of these two formed the balance of the ocean, how
    the waves are violent during some years and calm during others.  '
  - 'That sounds familiar to a childhood story I used to hear. Were the two deities
    children? A girl and a boy?  '
  - "Yes, it\u2019s said that the two beings took the form of two young nymphs, one
    girl and one boy. "
  - 'To us, the boy is said to have raised the mountains with the power of storms,
    while the girl used her flute to blow the seeds across the land, raising grass
    and trees. '
  - 'Out of curiosity, how did the story end? You mentioned they raised Nif out of
    water.  '
  - "Yes. But the story doesn\u2019t reveal what happened to them in the end. The
    tale ends with how they rose Nif from the bottom of the ocean. "
  - "Is that a coincidence? The story I heard also doesn\u2019t mention anything
    about what happened to them. Just that they escaped to a land far into the ocean. "
  - 'Although the story is a legend at this point, our elders often regard it as
    the truth. '
  - 'And Nif has something to do with that beginning. '
  - 'To us, this place serves as a shelter for us, free from the world outside. Almost
    like a gift from those before us. But as much as we are hidden here though, we
    are still trapped. '
  - 'And sometimes one of us has an annoying sister who begs to leave. '
  - 'Hmm. To us humans, we see the labyrinth as the last remaining challenge of the
    world, refusing to spit out its secrets.  '
  - "The more we try to delve into it, the more it tries to reject us. But that only
    tempts us more. We\u2019re all curious about what secrets this place holds.  "
  - ...
  - "Stories from our ancestors tell that the world outside of Nif is cruel and harsh.
    Even the murals in the village show this. Doesn\u2019t that book of yours also
    mention how this place is shrouded by fierce storms? "
  - "I had always thought of this place as a haven, where us nymphs can be safe.
    But everytime a two tail visits us, they always bring wondrous stories of the
    world outside. I\u2019m not really sure what to think about it anymore. "
  - "It seems we\u2019re both starting to realize that there is more to this place,
    with secrets that can only be discovered by rushing headfirst into its currents.  "
