  dialogues:
  - Usanoo, Merrow mentioned a substance called anima right? And how it condenses
    into crystals?
  - "Unfortunately, I don\u2019t know too much about it. The great seers would be
    the only ones who know a lot about it."
  - But I know those blue crystals are immense sources of power. Some of the relics
    left behind by our ancestors often have blue crystals embedded in them.
  - Some of them create a blinding light that annihilates any foe, and some of those
    relics can even cause bones to move.
  - Raising the dead? I wonder if those blue crystals have anything to do with the
    skeletons then.
  - 'Skeletons? Oh the bones. '
  - "The power you are talking about sounds like you\u2019re bringing back those
    who once lived."
  - "Isn\u2019t that what the skeletons are?"
  - "The skeletons don\u2019t breathe, swim, or talk. They mindlessly chase after
    us. Even if they are made out of the bodies of those who\u2019ve died, they don\u2019t
    resemble anything like them anymore."
  - 'I see. Rather than raising the dead, it wills life? '
  - "There\u2019s a famous saying that\u2019s passed through the stories we hear
    from our elders. "
  - "\u201CYour body returns beneath the waves, but your mind returns to the sky.\u201D "
  - 'Your mind being the anima inside you? '
  - 'I think so. Merrow says that once it leaves you, it flows and breaks apart,
    and it becomes impossible for it to retain its original form as the memories
    you once had. '
  - "She always mentions the vast currents of anima flowing through the air, but
    it\u2019s hard to imagine anything vast between these stone walls. "
  - "Oh, right. You\u2019ve never seen the sky. "
  - 'The sky?  '
  - "An endless expanse above you. There\u2019s no limit to how high you can go.
    Water also falls from it sometimes."
  - 'Does that mean we can swim up it? '
  - Not a lot of water. Just tiny droplets. So that the plants on the land have water
    to drink.
  - 'Ah. Two tails always mention huge expanses of lands called continents.  '
  - "Yes. Most of us live on those lands. We\u2019ve built huge structures from stone,
    cultivated large plots of land to grow crops. "
  - 'That sounds nice to have a big home. If you have so much space, why did you
    all come here then? '
  - "Well for me and Tabitha, we just want to know more about this place. It\u2019s
    the last remaining mystery of our world, and our curiosity drives us forward. "
  - "Geordi gets money from other humans by killing monsters and repairing ships.
    He sends the money back home to support his family. Although I\u2019m sure he\u2019s
    also curious about this labyrinth too. "
  - "I\u2019m not sure about Rowan and Elora, though. "
  - "Aren\u2019t you afraid of leaving your home behind though? "
  - 'Of course we all are. I miss Zunis dearly. '
  - "But there\u2019s something amazing about this adventure that we can\u2019t quite
    put down. "
  - 'I see. '
  - 'I should get back to preparing the supplies for the next expedition.  '
