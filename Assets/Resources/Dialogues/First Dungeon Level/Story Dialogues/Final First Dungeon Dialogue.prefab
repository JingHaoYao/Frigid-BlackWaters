  dialogues:
  - The crew makes a stop at an inn at the frontier outpost, and Malfar returns to
    visit.
  - Hello Malfar! We passed the trial and will be heading back to the town soon.
  - '...Hey Tabitha, I actually have another request for your crew: could you take
    me with you?'
  - Back to the town?
  - 'No, as in deeper into the dungeon - I want to be part of the crew. '
  - I can't really fight or shoot a musket, and I don't know much about sailing either.
  - But I do know a lot about science and human anatomy, so if there's anything that
    you all are curious about, I can try to explain it.
  - I can't get very far with writing this chapter if I don't see things for myself.
  - "... well I think we can buy more than enough supplies for one more member. I\u2019m
    sure the others would be happy to have you too."
  - '...oh! That was easier than I thought it would be. Thank you both of you.'
  - Go pack your stuff then, we'll be leaving shortly.
  - Malfar and Tabitha exit the inn, but leaves behind the world key on a table. The
    massive book is flipped to beginning of chapter 67.
  - You peer into the book, curious of what it says.
  - '"Chapter 67 - The labyrinth: Introduction-..."'
  - '"This giant megastructure was found an estimated 8000 years ago in the northern
    peak of the western ocean."'
  - '"Spanning the size of a large city, and shrouded by raging storms and frigid
    blackwaters, it is the last remaining landmass that has yet to be explored."'
  - '"However, there are always those who press forward, with an unrelenting desire
    for exploration and a boundless mind filled with curiosity."'
  - '"Tales of great heroic feats, dangerous monsters and powerful magic, along with
    unexplained phenomenon began to return to human civilization in a revolutionary
    wave."'
  - "\u201CIn time, this gave rise to multiple water towns at the so called peak of
    the world. With adventurers from all over the world travelling north to brave
    the labyrinth.\u201D"
  - '"But this seemingly unlimited trove of wealth, glory, and power has claimed the
    lives of many of those adventurers who were drawn in."'
  - " \u201CBut while the fire of passion of adventurers is often snuffed out by the
    bitter cold, the trail of the ashes left behind ignite the embers of those who
    follow it.\u201D"
  - "After reading the introduction, you take a look at your crew and wonder to yourself
    what\u2019s to come on this journey."
  - '... you take a step back and smile. You think serenely of your experiences so
    far. '
  - Hey everyone! Let's get going back to the town now!
  - Hearing this, you quickly find your spot at the helm of the ship as your crew's
    navigator.
