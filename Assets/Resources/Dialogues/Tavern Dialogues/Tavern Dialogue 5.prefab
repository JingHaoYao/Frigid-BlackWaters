  dialogues:
  - You walk into the tavern and spot Tabitha and Malfar sitting together, enjoying
    some food.
  - Tabitha quickly spots you, and ushers you over.
  - Heya Navigator! you should join us!
  - You find yourself seated at a small round table near the corner of the tavern
    with two of your shipmates.
  - Were you looking for some food, Navigator? Today's special is fishman meat! There's
    been an abundance of them lately swimming around in the first level.
  - '...!? Tabitha you didn''t tell me this was fishman meat!'
  - '...? You don''t like fishman meat?'
  - It's not that.. don't fishman sometimes eat humans? Plus it feels weird to eat
    something that's intelligent enough to use tools.
  - Hmm..
  - We eat plants sometimes right? Shouldn't you be bothered by that too? Since human
    corpses decompose into the soil.
  - That's less direct than a fishman eating human flesh though. It's hard to think
    of soil as human remains.
  - In the same way though, you're not eating human flesh directly by eating fishman
    meat. Just like plants, they've converted the energy in the body into their growth.
  - Plus, fishman meat is really similar to the meat from common fish in the sea.
    For me, it's hard to see it as anything similar to humans.
  - '...I see. When I saw my plate, I did think it was just some fish they caught
    in the morning haul.'
  - To be honest, it's my first time really trying anything uncommon. I've always
    eaten common food items when I grew up in Zunis.
  - I think you'll find yourself enjoying a lot of the new foods we find in the labyrinth.
    It's part of the fun from adventuring.
