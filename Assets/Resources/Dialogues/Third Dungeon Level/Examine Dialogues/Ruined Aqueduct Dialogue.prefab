  - Hey Navigator.
  - This reminds me of this building in Zunis that was destroyed in the war. All that
    was left standing was part of the pathway that led into it from other stone buildings.
  - We were really scared during the war, when we heard the explosions. My parents
    hid me under the floor boards in the kitchen. Luckily, only a small part of Zunis
    was destroyed but..
  - Maybe Those who were living here in the labyrinth wasn't so lucky.
