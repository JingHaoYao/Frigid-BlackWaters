  dialogues:
  - "We\u2019ve returned Julius. It took us a while to carve out the giant creature,
    but I think we\u2019ve collected a sufficient amount of lining from the inside
    of its scales. "
  - "Great job. I\u2019ll get started on the lining then. "
  - 'By the way Julius, I wanted to talk to you. '
  - One Zunisian to another, huh?
  - "Yes. I\u2019m training to become a scholar at the moment at the grand library."
  - "A scholar? I could never handle all the book reading that\u2019s needed for that.
    When my coming of age ceremony happened, I took apprenticeship under the ship-smiths
    of the northern docks.  "
  - "That\u2019s rare. Most Zunisians I know would never want to work a super physical
    job like that.  "
  - 'I was always a hands on person, so I was a lot different from most of my friends
    at home.  '
  - I wanted to build ships to sail the world. I hated how both the ocean and the
    valleys of sand separated worlds that were meant to be explored.
  - "Adventure called when my mentor and captain spoke about the wonders of this labyrinth.
    And that\u2019s how I ended up with my crew today.  "
  - "You\u2019re like me then. Only that I wanted to read of other places in books
    and scrolls. I never expected myself to come to this labyrinth to begin with. "
  - 'But when I heard about the legends and tales that have arisen from this place,
    I knew I had to come here. And I found a great crew to travel with.  '
  - 'Do you ever miss Zunis, Malfar?  '
  - 'I do. All the time. I miss the high ceilings of the grand library and the aqueducts
    that glistened blue under the sun.  '
  - "But I'll be returning with so many stories and sights to fill books, so that
    future generations can read in awe of what I\u2019ve done.  "
  - "That\u2019s a great dream to have. I\u2019ve always wanted to build a ship that
    my crew could sail on and become legends with. Our very own legendary ship with
    its legendary crew.  "
  - 'But that starts with perfecting my trade. It was great talking with you, Malfar.  '
  - 'Likewise, Julius. '
