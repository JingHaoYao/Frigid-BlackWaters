  dialogues:
  - 'Hey Willow. We brought back some of the plants that you described.  '
  - Thank you, Tabitha.
  - "Willow proceeds to place some of the plants on Elora\u2019s leg.  "
  - Hey Willow?
  - 'Yes Tabitha? '
  - 'How do you know so much about these blue crystals? I mean, you did have your
    experiments but.. '
  - 'Why did you try in the first place?  '
  - "\u2026 "
  - "There\u2019s only us now but, we had another friend. Mark. He had the same thing
    that Elora has. This disease that we call \u201CFragmenting\u201D."
  - "It was hard. Julius\u2019 crew and I tried many things. Only a handful were helpful.
    \ "
  - He lost to it in the end. His entire body crystallized, and a few days after his
    death, the crystals that made up his body fell apart and shattered, drifting away
    in the waves.
  - "We didn\u2019t know how it started but.. It\u2019s hard to be angry at it. Especially
    since we felt like nothing we did could help. "
  - "We just felt hopeless. And with the dangers of the fifth level in the way, we
    couldn\u2019t even attempt to reach the end of the labyrinth to begin with.  "
  - "When I see Rowan\u2019s affection for Elora.. It reminds me of how I cared for
    Mark. He was young too. "
  - 'While you were out gathering materials, Rowan''s been taking care of her with
    everything he can. Helping out with bandaging, food or applying any medicine.
    And most importantly, comforting her.  '
  - "I don\u2019t want him to feel the same pain that I did. "
  - 'I wonder how they know each other. They clearly care for each other deeply. '
  - 'They were already together when I met them on the ports of Celedon. '
  - I see...
  - "That girl, Elora, is incredible. She\u2019s so strong and still smiling through
    all of this. And most of all, she\u2019s ambitious. Relentlessly, she wants to
    venture forward. "
  - "...I\u2019m sorry to hear about Mark.  "
  - "And what you said about Elora\u2026 I\u2019ve noticed the same too. She may seem
    like a gentle and vulnerable girl, but there\u2019s a strength in her that comes
    from her curiosity. "
  - "It\u2019s been a long time since Mark passed away, so don\u2019t worry about
    it. "
  - "I hope I\u2019ll be able to see Elora again, but strong and healthy. "
  - "We\u2019ll come find you Willow! I promise you that. "
